A surrogate model is an approximation method that mimics the behavior of a computationally
expensive simulation. In more mathematical terms: suppose we are attempting to optimize a function
`f(p)`, but each calculation of `f` is very expensive. It may be the case we need to solve a PDE for each point or use advanced numerical linear algebra machinery, which is usually costly. The idea is then to develop a surrogate model `g` which approximates `f` by training on previous data collected from evaluations of `f`.
The construction of a surrogate model can be seen as a three-step process:

1. Sample selection
2. Construction of the surrogate model
3. Surrogate optimization
